# interactive-map

A PHP web application to help manage and configure sets of interactive maps. We are using leaflet to render maps. 

Maps are configured with javascript files. This application tracks those javascript files along with corresponding meta data, like map name and related links. New maps can be created and existing maps can be edited or deleted. 

## Installation

We use the same configuration for PHP applications. To make sure the documentation stays up to date, we maintain it separately. It is available here:
